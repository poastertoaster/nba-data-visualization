# Minutes per game vs Points per game
This Python script takes the [NBA Python helper library](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/) and [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) in order to generate charts for every team in the NBA comparing each player's minutes per game vs their points scored per game. Headshot images and player stats are sourced from [the official NBA stats website](https://stats.nba.com/).
